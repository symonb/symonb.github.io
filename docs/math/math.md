# Math section

Topics not exclusively related to UAVs (otherwise they should be in the [Drone](../drone/) section). Here you can search for in-depth explanations with equations and graphs. Although these posts were created with a broad audience in mind they are "drone-contaminated" - sorry that's my vulnerability. Nevertheless, I hope you can find something interesting or/and useful.
