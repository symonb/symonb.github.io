# Sensor fusion

Sensor fusion - a process of combining a few sensors' measurements to achieve better accuracy than it would be possible when the sources were used separately.

If you want basic stabilization and attitude estimation check [this post](./attitude_estim_theory),
for real implementation check [this](../../drone/sensor_fusion/attitude_estim_impl).

If you want to learn about Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter check [this post](./altitude_estim_theory),
for real implementation check [this](../../drone/sensor_fusion/altitude_estim_impl).
